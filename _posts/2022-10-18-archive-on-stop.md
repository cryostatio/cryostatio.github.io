Hello, readers!

There is a new option by default for Custom Flight Recording creation to have the recording automatically archived on stop. 

When manually capturing a new recording in the **Recordings** tab, it is possible to select if it is going to be *Continuous* or with a fixed duration of time. Create a recording with a defined duration and keep the **Archive On Stop** option checked as below:

The recording state will change from RUNNING to STOPPED when the capture is concluded and the recording is automatically archived:

![Alt text](/images/archive-on-stop-3-post.png "Recordings View displaying Active Recordings and created recording in STOPPED state, with a notification indicating it has been archived")

Go to the Archived Recording tab to see the recording archived:

I hope you find this new option helpful and if you have any suggestions, comments, questions or want to contribute, feel free to connect with us on [Github](https://github.com/cryostatio).
