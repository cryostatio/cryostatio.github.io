Hello everyone,

Cryostat 4.1.0 has landed. It's a minor release in semantic versioning terms, but it's a big release in terms of functionality and features. Read on to find out what's new.

## Release Highlights

For further details on these items, [check the GitHub Discussions release announcement](https://github.com/cryostatio/cryostat/discussions/1189).

## Where can I get the latest version of Cryostat?
You can install Cryostat using our
[Kubernetes operator on OperatorHub.io](https://operatorhub.io/operator/cryostat-operator)
or via a
[Helm Chart](https://github.com/cryostatio/cryostat-helm/releases/tag/v2.1.0)
. As always, you can also run Cryostat in other environments with a little more manual setup.

If this is your first time installing Cryostat on Kubernetes, you can [Get Started](/get-started) right here on this
website.

If you had previously installed Cryostat Operator 4.0.x with OLM, then you may have already been upgraded to 4.1.0, or
else you should be able to approve and install the upgrade.
