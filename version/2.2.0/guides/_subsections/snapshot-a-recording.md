## [Snapshot a Recording](#snapshot-a-recording)
Snapshotting an active recording produces a new recording in the target JVM
named `snapshot-n`, where `n` is a natural number. This snapshot contains all of
the JFR data that was present in the target JVM at the time that the snapshot
was taken and is in the `STOPPED` state as soon as it is created (that is, the
snapshot will never record any further information and is fixed in size).
This is useful when you have an ongoing, continuous recording active in a
target application and want to preserve the specific information at a given
point in time. If the continuous source recording is configured with a maximum
event age or maximum recording size then the need for snapshots is more
apparent, since without snapshotting some older data will eventually be dropped
from the source recording and lost.
