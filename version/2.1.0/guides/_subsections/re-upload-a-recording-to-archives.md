## [Re-Upload a Recording to Archives](#re-upload-a-recording-to-archives)
After downloading an archived recording from Cryostat, it can be re-uploaded
into Cryostat's archives later. This is useful if, for example, your Cryostat
instance has been scaled down or undeployed for some time and the attached
storage lost, and you then want to use Cryostat's analysis tools with a
previously retrieved recording in a new Cryostat instance.
