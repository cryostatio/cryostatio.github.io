## [Viewing Archived Recordings](#view-archived-recordings)
There are two ways to view <i>Archived Recordings</i>. The first method is to navigate to the Archived Recordings tab. See <a href="#archive-a-recording">Archive a Recording</a>.

### [Archives View](#archives-view)

The second method is to navigate to the <i>Archives</i> tab on Cryostat console sidebar.

The Archives view gathers all of Cryostat's saved archived recordings into one view. Here, we are able to interact with any archived recordings that have been saved from discovered target JVMs, or that have been re-uploaded to Cryostat.

    {% capture navigate-to-archives-include-text %}
    <p>
        If no <i>Archived Recordings</i> are present, see <a href="#archive-a-recording">Archive a Recording</a> to create one.

    </a>
    <p>
      <br>
        Here, we can also directly re-upload saved <i>Archived Recordings</i>. See <a href="#re-upload-a-recording-to-archives">Re-Upload a Recording to Archives</a> for a similar guide.
