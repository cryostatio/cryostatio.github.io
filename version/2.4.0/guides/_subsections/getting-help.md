## [Getting Help](#getting-help)

The **Cryostat** web application contains online help resources that you can use to learn more about
how to use **Cryostat** directly within its interface.

### [Welcome Tour](#welcome-tour)

The *Welcome Tour* is a first-run introduction to **Cryostat** that you will see the first time you log in.
If you clear your browser's local storage, use a private browsing window, or use a different browser, you will see the *Tour* again.

If you have completed the tour previously, feel free to click <i>Skip Tour</i> and dive right in to **Cryostat**.
If you have not completed the tour previously and are unsure what **Cryostat** can do or how to use it, click <i>Get Started</i>
to begin the guided walkthrough of the **Cryostat Web** application.
