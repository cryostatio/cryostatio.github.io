## [Snapshot a Recording](#snapshot-a-recording)
Snapshotting an application produces a new `Flight Recording` named `snapshot-n`,
where `n` is a natural number. This `snapshot` contains all of the **JFR** data that
was present in the <code>target</code> **JVM** at the time that the `snapshot` was taken and is in
the `STOPPED` state as soon as it is created (that is, the` snapshot` will never
record any further information and is fixed in size). This is useful when you
have an ongoing, `Continuous Recording` active in a <code>target</code> application and want
to preserve the specific information at a given point in time. If the
`Continuous` source `Recording` is configured with a maximum event age or maximum
recording size then the need for `snapshots` is more apparent, since without
snapshotting, some older data will eventually be dropped and lost from the
source `Recording`. It is also useful when you have multiple concurrent source
`Recordings` running and want an easy way to capture the sum of all of their data
at a given point in time.
