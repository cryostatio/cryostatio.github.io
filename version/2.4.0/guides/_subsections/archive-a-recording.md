## [Archive a Recording](#archive-a-recording)
In contrast to `Active Recordings`, which reside within the container
of the `target` application, `Archived Recordings` reside within persistent
storage attached to a **Cryostat** instance. In **OpenShift**, for example, the
archives are stored in a `PersistentVolumeClaim`.

`Archived Recordings` are created by performing archival upon `Active Recordings`.
When this is requested, **Cryostat** connects to the `target` application and copies
the `Flight Recorder` data from the selected `Active Recording` into an `Archived
Recording` file in storage. The `Active Source Recording` may be `Continuous` or
`Fixed-duration`, using any *Event Template*, in
any state (`RUNNING`, `STOPPED`, etc.), and may even be a `snapshot`.
