## [Store JMX Credentials](#store-jmx-credentials)
If you have Java Management Extensions (JMX) authentication enabled on your containerized JVMs, Cryostat will prompt you to enter your JMX credentials before it can access the JDK flight recordings on your target JVMs. You can <a href="#configure-jmx-credentials-storage">Configure JMX Credentials Storage</a> and choose whether these credentials are held in browser memory for the current session only, or if they are uploaded to Cryostat's JMX credentials keyring.

If you intend to use Cryostat <a href="#create-an-automated-rule">Automated Rules</a>, then you should store target application JMX credentials in Cryostat's JMX credentials keyring, which is outlined below. Even if you do not use Automated Rules, you may find it more convenient to store credentials in the keyring. This way, the Cryostat web UI does not need to prompt you for credentials when you manually access JFR information about target applications.

          A modal will appear. You can select a target JVM to view its properties.
          These properties can be used to define a <i>matchExpression</i> that tests whether this set of credentials should apply to the selected target JVM.
          This is the same kind of <i>matchExpression</i> as those used by <a href='#create-an-automated-rule'>Automated Rules</a>, so you may find it useful to reuse the same
          <i>matchExpression</i> from your rule definitions for your credentials definitions.
          The <i>matchExpression</i>, username, and password fields are all required.

        Alternatively, JMX credentials may also be stored if you navigate to either the <i>Recordings</i> tab or the <i>Events</i> tab and select a target JVM with JMX authentication enabled. The authentication form will appear, prompting you to enter your JMX credentials. If you have <a href='#configure-jmx-credentials-storage'>configured Backend JMX Credentials Storage</a>, then a new credentials definition with the provided username and password will be stored for this specific target application in the Cryostat keyring. If you have configured JMX credentials with the <i>Session</i> option then these entered credentials will <i>not</i> be stored in the Cryostat keyring.

        The <i>Store JMX Credentials</i> table will update with rows for each of the credentials you have stored in the keyring. The <i>matchExpression</i> is visible along with a count of the number of known target applications that these credentials will apply to. You can click the reverse chevron icon at the left of the table row to expand the row, which will display a list of those matched target applications. For security reasons it is not possible to view the stored username and password associated with a credentials definition in the keyring.
