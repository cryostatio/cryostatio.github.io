## [Create an Automated Rule](#create-an-automated-rule)

`Automated Rules` are configurations that instruct **Cryostat** to create **JDK** `Flight Recordings` on matching
`target` **JVM** applications. Each `Automated Rule` specifies parameters for which *Event Template* to use, how
much data should be kept in the application recording buffer, and how frequently **Cryostat** should copy the
application recording buffer into **Cryostat's** own archived storage.

Once you've created a rule, **Cryostat** immediately matches it against all existing discovered `targets` and starts your `Flight Recording`. **Cryostat** will also apply the rule to newly discovered `targets` that match its definition. You can create multiple rules to match different subsets of `targets` or to layer different recording options for your needs.

We'll walk through two use cases: `Continuous` monitoring in a containerized **JVM**, and `Custom` monitoring with **Kubernetes** labels or annotations.

### [Continuous Monitoring in a Containerized JVM](#continuous-monitoring-in-a-containerized-jvm)

Previously, if we wanted to enable always-on `Continuous` monitoring using **JDK** Flight Recorder **(JFR)** in a containerized Java virtual machine **(JVM)**, we would set **JVM** flags on the `target` application, then restart the application to start monitoring. With **Cryostat's** `Automated Rules`, we can enable **JDK** Flight Recorder  **(JFR)** at runtime to continuously monitor an already-running `target` application, with no restart, no redeploy, and no downtime.

            The <code>Match Expression</code> in a rule definition is a Java-like snippet of code that <b>Cryostat</b> interprets and uses to determine if a rule should be applied to any given <code>target</code>. <code>Match Expressions</code> should thus evaluate to a <code>boolean</code> value. The simplest <code>Match Expressions</code> would be the <code>booleans</code> true or false; if we use true, the rule will apply to every <code>target</code>. The <code>Expression</code> has a <code>target</code> object in global scope, with the following form in <code>JSON</code> notation:
        </p>
        <figure>
{% highlight json %}
{
  "alias": "myAppAlias",
  "connectUrl": "service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://cryostat:9091/jmxrmi",
  "labels": {
    "com.example/service": "customer-login",
  },
  "annotations": {
    "platform": {
      "io.kubernetes/annotation": "annotated"
    },
    "cryostat": {

        <p>
          The <i>Alias, connectUrl, labels, annotations.platform,</i> and <i>annotations.cryostat</i> properties are all guaranteed to be present on the <code>target</code> object. <i>alias</i> and <i>connectUrl</i> will be non-empty strings. The <i>labels</i> and <i>platform annotations</i> may be empty—in <b>OpenShift</b> or <b>Kubernetes</b>, these are populated from the labels and annotations applied to the <code>target’s</code> pod, if any. The <b>Cryostat</b> annotations map will vary per platform, but on <b>OpenShift</b> or <b>Kubernetes</b> you can expect the <i>HOST, PORT, NAMESPACE,</i> and <i>POD_NAME</i> keys to be present and non-empty.

          Here are some examples of <code>Match Expressions</code>:

### [Custom Monitoring with Kubernetes Labels or Annotations](#custom-monitoring-with-kubernetes-labels-or-annotations)

We can define a rule that applies to any `target` application that has platform-specific attributes, such as **Kubernetes** labels or annotations. Here's an example in `JSON` notation:

<figure>
{% highlight json %}

{
  "name": "k8sMonitoring",
  "description": "Enable the Demo template on any target with the jfrMonitoring=true annotation",
  "matchExpression": "target.annotations.platform[‘jfrMonitoring’]==’enabled’",
  "eventSpecifier": "template=Demo,type=CUSTOM",
  "archivalPeriodSeconds": 300,
  "preservedArchives": 12
}

{% endhighlight %}

  <figcaption>
    To create this rule with the <b>Cryostat</b> UI, follow the guide in <a href="{{ page.url }}#continuous-monitoring-in-a-containerized-jvm">Continuous Monitoring in a Containerized JVM</a>.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Once we've created this rule definition, **Cryostat** will check all of the existing `target` applications and watch for new `targets` that appear with the `jfrMonitoring=enabled` annotation. Any matching `targets` found will have a `Recording` started automatically using the *Custom Demo* template from our first use case. It will take an `Archived snapshot` every five minutes and maintain an hour’s worth of these archives in storage.

With this rule definition in place, **Kubernetes** or **Red Hat OpenShift** users can use familiar tools like `kubectl/oc` or the `OpenShift console` to mark `target` applications for monitoring, without needing to interact directly with the **Cryostat** API or UI. This opens the door to further automating your workflow.

As an example, you might use or implement an `Operator` that monitors traffic flow or pod restarts and enables monitoring on pods after some criterion threshold is met, then disables it again if the `target` application's behavior returns to normal. As a **Kubernetes** administrator, you could receive a notification when this occurs and check the **Cryostat** archives to retrieve <code><b>JDK</b> Flight Recorder</code> data from the `target` application recorded during the problematic period, or you could view these `Archived Recordings` in **Cryostat’s Grafana** dashboard.

<span style="color:red">**Note**</span>: An important caveat is that **Cryostat** does not watch for changes in the **Kubernetes** annotations or labels; it only watches to see if `target` applications appear or disappear. To apply the annotation to a `target` application, we must apply the annotation or label to the application *pod* (which will cause **Kubernetes** to roll out a new replica), and not to the deployment.
