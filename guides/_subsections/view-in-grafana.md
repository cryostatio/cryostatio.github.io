## [View a Recording in Grafana](#view-a-recording-in-grafana)
Cryostat provides integration with Grafana to plot curated time series
metrics from a recording. By selecting _View in Grafana_ on either an
_Active_ or _Archived Recording_, Cryostat uploads your recording to
a custom Grafana Data Source, and launches Grafana in a new browser
tab. If Cryostat was installed to a Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster using the
Cryostat Operator, you must retrieve the credentials generated
by the operator in order to log into Grafana. These credentials are stored
in a Kubernetes Secret. Once logged in, navigate to the dashboard titled
_Dashboard_. You will see a variety of metrics plotted from your recording.
