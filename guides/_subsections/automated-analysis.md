## [View Automated Analysis for a Recording](#view-automated-analysis-for-a-recording)
Cryostat integrates the same automated analysis reports that you would
find in [JDK Mission Control ("JMC")](https://github.com/openjdk/jmc). The
JMC rules engine analyzes your recording and looks for common problems,
assigning a severity score from 0 (no problem) to 100 (potentially
severe problem) to each potential problem type.

Cryostat also provides an *Automated Analysis Card* that is able to display
the same information in a more flexible format, with more tools and control
over the data you see and the ability to resize the view. The card is available
for use in the *Dashboard*. Read the section on the
[Automated Analysis Card](#automated-analysis-card) for more information.

## [View and Download Automated Analysis for a Recording](#view-and-download-automated-analysis-for-a-recording)
**Cryostat** integrates the same `Automated Analysis` reports that you would
find in [`JDK Mission Control`](https://github.com/openjdk/jmc). The
`JMC` rules engine analyzes your `Recording` and looks for common problems
and assigns a severity score from 0 (no problem) to 100 (potentially
severe problem). Results with score 0 are hidden from the report unless
you select the _Show OK Results_ checkbox. More details on each
result can be found by clicking on the _+_ symbol to the right of
the rule name. These details often include suggestions on how to fix
the problem. **Cryostat** also allows you to download the report `HTML` file
for offline use.

**Cryostat** also provides an *Automated Analysis Card* that is able to display the same information in a more user-friendly format, with more tools and control over the data you see. The card is available for use in the *Dashboard*. Read the section on the [*Automated Analysis Card*](#automated-analysis-card) for more information.
