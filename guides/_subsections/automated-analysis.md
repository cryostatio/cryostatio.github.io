## [View and Download Automated Analysis for a Recording](#view-and-download-automated-analysis-for-a-recording)
Cryostat integrates the same automated analysis reports that you would
find in [JDK Mission Control](https://github.com/openjdk/jmc). The
JMC rules engine analyzes your recording and looks for common problems
and assigns a severity score from 0 (no problem) to 100 (potentially
severe problem). Results with score 0 are hidden from the report unless
you select the _Show OK Results_ checkbox. More details on each
result can be found by clicking on the _+_ symbol to the right of
the rule name. These details often include suggestions on how to fix
the problem. Cryostat also allows you to download the report HTML file
for offline use.

Cryostat also provides an *Automated Analysis Card* that is able to display the same information in a more user-friendly format, with more tools and control over the data you see. The card is available for use in the *Dashboard*. Read the section on the [Automated Analysis Card](#automated-analysis-card) for more information.
