## [View Automated Analysis for a Recording](#view-automated-analysis-for-a-recording)
**Cryostat** integrates the same `Automated Analysis` reports that you would
find in [JDK Mission Control ("JMC")](https://github.com/openjdk/jmc). The
**JMC** rules engine analyzes your `Recording` and looks for common problems,
assigning a severity score from 0 (no problem) to 100 (potentially
severe problem) to each potential problem type.

**Cryostat** also provides an `Automated Analysis Card` that is able to display
the same information in a more flexible format, with more tools and control
over the data you see and the ability to resize the view. The `Card` is available
for use in the *Dashboard*. Read the section on the
[`Automated Analysis Card`](#automated-analysis-card) for more information.
