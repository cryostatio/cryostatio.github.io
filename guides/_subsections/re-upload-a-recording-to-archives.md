## [Re-Upload a Recording to Archives](#re-upload-a-recording-to-archives)
After downloading an `Archived Recording` from **Cryostat**, it can be re-uploaded
into **Cryostat's** archives later. This is useful if, for example, your **Cryostat**
instance has been scaled down or undeployed for some time and the attached
storage is lost, and you then want to use **Cryostat's** analysis tools with a
previously retrieved <code>Recording</code> in a new **Cryostat** instance.
