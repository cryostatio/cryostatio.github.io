## [Download an Active or Archived Recording](#download-an-active-or-archived-recording)
**Cryostat** provides some basic capabilities for analysis of **Flight Recording** data
in-cluster. However, the core analysis workflow is to collect **JFR** files from
`target` applications and copy them to local developer or admin workstations, then
use [`JDK Mission Control`](https://github.com/openjdk/jmc) for the heavy lifting.

        the <code>Archived Recording</code>, and a <code>.json</code> file containing any
        <code>Metadata Labels</code> that were attached. It may take some time for these dialogs
        to appear. Once it does, you can choose to open the <code>Recording</code> file directly
        in <code>JDK Mission Control</code>, or (recommended) to save the <code>Recording</code> to disk.
